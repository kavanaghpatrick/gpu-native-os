# CRITICAL: Run tests serially to prevent GPU resource exhaustion.
# Apple Silicon M4 has ONE GPU - parallel test execution causes:
# - Command queue exhaustion (~256 limit)
# - GPU memory pressure
# - System hangs when multiple tests dispatch kernels simultaneously

[env]
# Rust test threads - single threaded to prevent GPU contention
